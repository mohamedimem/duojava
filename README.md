Course Notes Application
This application is designed to help you take notes while reading a course. It allows you to organize your notes into multiple chapters and specify tasks for each chapter. The tasks are categorized into three types:

Lesson: For taking notes and summarizing key points.

QCM: For creating multiple-choice questions to test your understanding.

TODO: A combination of Lesson and QCM tasks to ensure comprehensive learning.
